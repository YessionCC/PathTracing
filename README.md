# PathTracing
simple implementation of path tracing based on radiometry and BRDF, developed by VS2017

## Features
  1. Supporting several BSDF (materials) including diffusion, specular, refraction, glossy, metal, ceramic materials.
  2. Implementing radiometry based on Monte Carlo method.
  3. Using BVH structure and multithread to accelerate rendering
  4. Directly reading 3D datas from .obj files
  5. Supporting simple transformation
  6. Supporting sampling from light sources directly( however, time consuming will increase, decrease the number of iteration will balance )
  7. Supporting anti-aliasing (4x, 16x, or more)
  
## Next step?
  This project will not be updated for a long time.
